README for my Capstone Project: Predicting Stack Overflow Questions Quality Rating with NLP

Overview:

This project uses a dataset of 60,000 Stack Overflow questions, with labels indicating the quality of each question, to train models that predict question quality.

Data:

The data was obtained from Kaggle and was split into train and validation sets by the dataset owner. The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imoore/60k-stack-overflow-questions-with-quality-rate

Contents:

1. Notebooks:

There are two notebooks associated with this project:

1. Notebook1 Main: Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA), Feature Engineering, Vectorization and Modeling Notebook

2. Notebook2 Deeplearning: Deep Learning and Advanced Modeling Notebook 

Notes:

- The first notebook uses the base conda environment from the BrainStation curriculum. The second notebook uses the deep_learning conda environment from the same curriculum.

- To run the second notebook, the first notebook must be run to completion (the necessary code block is located above part 4 of the first notebook).
